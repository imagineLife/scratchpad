		Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning, because 
		today we are not merely transferring power from one administration 
		to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring 
		power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.

		For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped
